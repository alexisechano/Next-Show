## Overview
### Description
A TV show recommender app that uses personal ratings and interests to aggregate a user's next binge!

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Entertainment, social
- **Mobile:** Mobile first experience
- **Story:** Allows users to find their next possibly-life changing TV show and share their review with others
- **Market:** Anyone who enjoys the entertainment industry and as streaming services increase in popularity and become more prevalent, this is a helpful application to aid in putting the watcher first and helps avoid the endless scrolling of shows on Netflix, Hulu, etc.
- **Habit:** After they finish a good show, they return to the app to find a new one OR help a friend/family find the new shot show. It is habit forming and as long as a person is interested in filling up their time with TV, the app keeps runnning!
- **Scope:** In a narrow focus, this app just has a news feed with search/ilter features and a user profile. The news feed will JUST show top tv shows and ones that are similar to the ones the user selects or rates. In the future, we can add sharing and more social-network-y features.
